# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

## 1. What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment includes any unwelcome actions, words, or gestures of a sexual nature that make someone feel uncomfortable, scared, or disrespected. This can happen in places like work, school, or public areas. Here are some examples:

- **Unwanted Comments or Jokes:** Making sexual jokes, teasing someone about their body, or saying inappropriate things.
- **Physical Touch:** Touching someone without their permission, like patting, pinching, or any kind of unwanted physical contact.
- **Inappropriate Pictures or Videos:** Showing or sharing sexual images or content that makes others feel uncomfortable.
- **Offering Favors in Exchange for Something:** Asking for sexual favors in return for job promotions, better grades, or other benefits (this is called "quid pro quo" harassment).
- **Creating a Hostile Environment:** Making someone feel unsafe or uncomfortable regularly, even without direct physical contact, through behavior, comments, or actions.

Basically, if someone feels uneasy or disrespected because of another person's actions, it might be considered sexual harassment.

## 2. What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

If you experience or witness sexual harassment, consider the following steps:

- **Address the behaviour directly:** If safe, communicate to the harasser that their conduct is unwelcome and must stop.​
- **Report the incident:** Notify your organization's designated authority, such as the Human Resources department or the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC), following the procedures outlined in your organization's Prevention of Sexual Harassment (PoSH) policy.​
- **Document the incidents:** Keep detailed records of each occurrence, including dates, times, locations, individuals involved, and any witnesses.​
- **Seek support:** Reach out to trusted colleagues, friends, or professional support services to discuss the situation and receive guidance.​
- **Utilize external resources:** If internal resolution is insufficient, consider contacting external bodies such as the Sexual Harassment Redressal Committee or legal authorities for further assistance.
